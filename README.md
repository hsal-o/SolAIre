	<b>SolAIRe</b> is a <b>Text-based AI simulation</b> game featuring <b>Bilbo</b>, a determined dwarf who embarks on space mining expeditions in pursuement of great fortune.
</p>

## 📘&nbsp; Description
SolAIre employs a well-structured finite state machine to mimic how Bilbo, our AI dwarf, 
makes decisions and acts.

Bilbo can pause his actions to rest when he's tired back home, knows when his backpack is full from 
exploring caves, and heads to the trading tarps to trade his ores for gold. Bilbo the Dwarf is 
constantly being refined in its decision making as more advanced AI techniques are being 
implemented and with new waves of environments and characters, Bilbo will always have 
something to do.

## 📍&nbsp; Current Game Locations
Bilbo the Dwarf can currently head to the following areas when it sees fit. The locations are listed below:

  * <b>Bilbo's Home</b>		
	
    <i>Bilbo will head here to rest if he drains his energy in any activity.</i>

  * The Mines</b>
	
	<i>Its favorite spot, Bilbo will actively seek out the mines in hopes of mining valuable ores 
	it can trade in for riches.</i>

  * The Bank</b>
	
	<i>If Bilbo finds his pockets too full to carry his precious gold nuggets, it'll head over to 
	the bank to deposit them and to revel at the riches its collected so far.</i>

  * The Trading Tarps</b>
	
	<i>After mining for some time and finding his backpack full to the brim with ores, Bilbo will
	head over to the tarps to trade his ores for gold with vendors.</i>

More Locations are planned to be added such as a <b>Saloon</b> Bilbo can drink and interact with fellow
dwarves at, to a <b>Dwarf Store</b> Bilbo can visit to purchase better clothing, mining equipment, and backpacks.

## 👥&nbsp; Current NPC's
There are currently no NPC's except for Bilbo. There are plans to add fellow dwarves to keep Bilbo company.
